Since little I was fascinated by autonomous robots and this passion has since them motivated me to pursue more advanced degrees and careers in the related fields. As of today, there are still a great number of issues in the autonomous driving realm waiting to be overcome in order to make automated vehicles safe and reliable. To this end,I want to contribute head-on and hands-on to make autonomous driving a true reality in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
