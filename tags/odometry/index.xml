      <description>&lt;p&gt;Have you wonder once, &amp;ldquo;Well, I have read through so many papers, taken so many courses related to SLAM and localization but somehow I am still not sure how to implement the whole code base myself.&amp;rdquo;. If you had this thought once during your learning process, then you are not alone, my friend. Today I will share my experience of how I had tackled this dilemma myself after years and years and comprehending how pose estimation and SLAM actually works despite how many literature I had gone throughout all this time.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
