      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;what-is-line-fitting&#34;&gt;What is line fitting?&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is actually one derived case of optimization problem; linear optimization to be more precise. As we need to be able to tell or model a tendency out of a bunch of samples that may look irregular at first, we need certain mathematical tools to do so. In all these mathematical tools, we recurr to optimization to help us model a bunch of samples a reasonable model.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am currently based at the Bay Area near San Francisco, CA. If you are around the area, we can grab a coffee and discuss how I can contribute.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you wish to reach out, you can do so by &lt;a href=&#34;amilto:charly.charlongo@gmail.com&#34;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Have a good one and thank you.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi everyone, this is Charly Huang and I am a software engineer interested in autonomous navigation related algorithms and software development. Since little I was fascinated by autonomous robots and this passion has since them motivated me to pursue more advanced degrees and careers in the related fields. As of today, there are still a great number of issues in the autonomous driving realm waiting to be overcome in order to make automated vehicles safe and reliable. To this end,I want to contribute head-on and hands-on to make autonomous driving a true reality in the near future.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;About a year-and-a-half in my latest profession, I started to think how should I am able to justify myself fto be a robotic professional capable of understanding, designing, and developing complex projects involving integrating autonomous navigation technology into modern day&amp;rsquo;s robots. Please also be aware that we are stepping into an ae of rapid and ever-evolving age of generative AI in which people are constantly proposing extremely revolutionizing concepts and tools to aid in different tasks in such a magnitude that is not previously expected.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
